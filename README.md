# FB-examples
A repository where I put examples of my code. The commit history often doesn’t reflect the creation date of the actual file. I will try to include creation dates in the individual files. This repository puts on display the progression of my programming skills over my CS career. 

A note to CIS students thinking about plagiarizing some of the content in this repository -- you learn more when struggling through a problem then just copying the answer. If you want to be good at what you do, don’t plagiarize.
